This analysis explores the relationship between climate variables (temperature and precipitation) and the rate of glacial retreat in the Himalayas. Using a multiple regression model, the analysis identifies how rising temperatures significantly accelerate glacial retreat, while precipitation has a more complex effect that varies with seasonal patterns. The findings highlight the critical impact of climate change on the region's glaciers.
