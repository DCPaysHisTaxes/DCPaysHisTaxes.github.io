Introduction:

In "A Letter to the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education - A Call for Review of 'OKCupid Data for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses'" by Xiao and Ma, the ethical dilemma of potentially revealing and analyzing confidential data is stringently examined. To place this into perspective, the essay was a response to "OKCupid Data for Introductory Statistics and Data Science Courses" by Kim and Escobedo-Land, who had proposed using the OKCupid data as a pedagogical tool for statistics and data science courses. But Xiao and Ma are against using this approach on the grounds that use of identity-disclosing variables would expose users to a vast risk of loss of privacy. Specifically, they note the introduction of variables that would lead to violations of confidentiality and risk to individuals. 

Kim and Escobedo-Land were initially prompted by the controversial 2016 release "The OKCupid Dataset: A Very Large Public Dataset of Dating Site Users" of Emil O. W. Kirkegaard and Julius D. Bjerrekær. Such a dataset had over 70,000 users' data, such as gender preference, age, username, geographic location, religion, and other sensitive data, in the intention to make it available for various purposes of research. However, the inclusion of some variables—such as timestamps and geospatial data—was a serious issue from the perspective of privacy. Such information were not anonymized sufficiently so that individuals could be traced. To minimize such risk, Xiao and Ma recommended injecting noise into the data (e.g., altering, moving, or erasing specific data points) for the purpose of improving user privacy protection.

Yet another similar paper, "Addressing Conceptual Gaps in Big Data Research Ethics: An Application of Contextual Integrity" by Michael Zimmer, also explains the ethical problems of using publicly available but sensitive data. Zimmer criticizes Kirkegaard and Bjerrekær for violating existing research standards and norms by supplying personally identifiable data such as geographic coordinates, usernames, and sexual orientation. He states that the data are technically public but should be handled with respect, upholding user anonymity and ethical research practices.

Questions:
1. What is the permission structure of using the data? Was it followed?

The data used in the initial study lacked a clearly defined permission structure. Both articles describe how the dataset was scraped and reused without notifying the concerned parties. Although OKCupid's user agreement indicates that some public data may be shared, using data that included usernames and gender preferences without direct user consent directly goes against Institutional Review Board (IRB) and ethical guidelines. This too is a violation of traditional research protocol, where the user's consent and privacy are protected.

2. Is the information identifiable? All of it? Part of it? How? Are the data anonymized sufficiently or old enough to be above ethical concerns? Is anonymity guaranteed?

The papers state clearly that there are some variables in the data set that are identifiable. Such variables include usernames, preferences about dating, geography, timestamps, and ages—personal information by which people may be identified. The data set is not well anonymized and therefore is re-identifiable. Although perhaps the data set was constructed before some of today's guidelines, the data set still violates standard practices of data privacy research and user protection research.

3. How was data collection done? Were the observations collected ethically? Are there missing observations?

The OKCupid dataset with dubious ethics was created by web scraping data about over 70,000 OKCupid users. The data were then structured for regression analysis to explore relationships between cognitive ability (measured by categorical questions) and other user characteristics (age, gender preference, location, etc.). The original researchers knew that nearly all users in the dataset had some missing data points. If researchers still wish to use this dataset while maintaining user confidentiality, researchers can use data masking techniques, convert categorical variables to dummy variables, or eliminate free-response questions entirely. Also, having data available only by way of secure, access-restricted environments needing IRB approval would be an improvement in regard to compliance with privacy guidelines.

4. Were the data publicly available?

Yes, the data were publicly available, which is the crux of the ethical debate. Although OKCupid datasets are technically available to users of the platform, making the entire dataset freely downloadable by the general public without limit was highly problematic. Without governance, the uncontrolled release escalated the risk of abuse, re-identification, and harm to individuals. The lack of gatekeeping meant that anyone could see the data, with or without purpose, leading to ethics breaches. As Michael Zimmer explains, the public nature of data does not negate ethical responsibility to consider user privacy, consent, and context. Without anonymization or ethical clearance, the release of the dataset violated not only OKCupid users' privacy expectations but also general data science research norms.
